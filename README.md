# Purpose

Implement a variant of the PL/C persistent diagnostic compiler originally developed at Cornell University to run on the IBM 360 computer.

# Why

Self-correcting program compiler design can improve user experience today.
Implementing these ideas in their original form can provide insight into reduced language subsets for efficient computation and programmer facilitation.

# Plan

- Install Hercules emulator for IBM 360 http://www.hercules-390.org/

- Load Turnkey MVT system image http://www.ibiblio.org/jmaynard/

- Test PL/I programs http://teampli.net/

- Read more about PL/C https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/5952

- Implement a subset for simple programs

- Progressively expand to more complex PL/I lanugage subsets

- Increase compiler persistence and facilitation
